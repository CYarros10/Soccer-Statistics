<h1>Soccer Stat Tracker</h1>

<p> This program allows someone to track the progress of a soccer player throughout one of his or her games. These stats include three different areas: Offense, Possession, Defense. After stats are input into the GUI, the user can discover how well the player did by calculating a match rating. The player information, match rating, game history, stats, and minutes played can all be saved to a file for future reference. A user can save player data after each game and all this data can be found on the same file. This allows the player to compare and evaluate his or her performances over a long period of time. </p>
